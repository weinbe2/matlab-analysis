When a set of runs is done, run:

./parse_allrow.sh ../discf8l16t32b50m060_ .sh-* 260 1250 10 input.dat 500

Where you modify the 'm060' if you're doing a partially quenched run.
It will spit out correlator files in the subdirectory 'corr'.

Note that it will override what's in corr. If you want to change that, you
can modify the file input.dat: the first column specifies the extension of
the files in the 'corr' subdirectory, so you could change corr.i2pi to
corr.i2pi_m080 if you did a quenched run at the mass 0.080, for example.
